# Hex Crusade Campaign Rules v1  
### Planetary-Scale Crusade System

---

## 1. Campaign Overview

This campaign represents a planet-scale war fought over a large hex-based map.  
Each player controls one army force that moves across the map, captures territory, and engages enemy forces when they collide.

Battles are fought using standard Warhammer 40,000 Crusade rules, with this system determining **where**, **when**, and **why** battles occur.

The campaign emphasizes:
- Spatial control
- Attrition and recovery
- Strategic movement
- Team coordination

---

## 2. The Hex Map

### Hex Types
Each hex on the map is one of the following:

- **Normal Hex** – No special effect.
- **Installation Hex** – Contains a strategic installation that provides mechanical benefits.
- **Spawn Hex** – A faction’s primary reinforcement point (see Section 6).

Some Installation Hexes may also be Urban, Industrial, or Fortified for narrative purposes.

---

## 3. Army Tokens

- Each player controls **one Army Token** representing their Crusade force.
- Army Tokens occupy one hex at a time.
- Multiple friendly Army Tokens may occupy the same hex.
- Enemy Army Tokens may never occupy the same hex unless a battle is triggered.

---

## 4. Campaign Turn Sequence

Each campaign round proceeds in the following order:

1. **Reinforcement Phase**
2. **Movement Phase**
3. **Collision & Battle Phase**
4. **Control Resolution Phase**
5. **Recovery Phase**

---

## 5. Movement Phase

### Movement Roll
- Each Army Token rolls **1D6** for movement.
- The result is the number of hexes the token may move this round.

### Movement Rules
- Army Tokens may move through:
  - Friendly-controlled hexes
  - Neutral hexes
- Army Tokens may **not** move through enemy-controlled hexes unless entering to attack.

### Ending Movement
- An Army Token may stop movement early.
- Movement must be declared hex by hex.

---

## 6. Spawn Points & Reinforcement (Critical Rule)

### Spawn Hexes
- Each faction begins the campaign with **one primary Spawn Hex**.
- Spawn Hexes represent orbital staging areas, fortified landing zones, or stable supply corridors.
- Spawn Hexes are always considered **friendly-controlled** and cannot be captured.

### Losing a Battle
If an Army Token **loses a battle**:

- The token is **removed from the map**.
- It is placed into **Reinforcement Status**.

### Reinforcement Status
- A token in Reinforcement Status may not move or fight.
- During the **Reinforcement Phase** of the next campaign round, the token is placed:
  - On its faction’s Spawn Hex, or
  - On a controlled Installation Hex with the **Void Port** trait (if any).

This represents regrouping, reinforcement, and redeployment.

---

## 7. Collision & Battles

### Triggering a Battle
- If an Army Token enters a hex occupied by an enemy Army Token:
  - Movement immediately ends.
  - A battle is scheduled between those forces.

### Battle Outcome
- The winner remains in the hex.
- The loser enters Reinforcement Status.
- The hex becomes controlled by the winner’s faction.

Only one battle may be triggered per Army Token per campaign round.

---

## 8. Hex Control

### Control States
- **Neutral** – No faction controls the hex.
- **Controlled** – A faction controls the hex.

Most hexes do not track percentages.

### Installation Hexes
Installation Hexes may track additional control states (25 / 75 / 100) if desired, but this is optional and not required for v1.

---

## 9. Installations (High-Level)

Installation Hexes provide **in-battle effects** to armies fighting battles while controlling that hex.

Examples:
- Administratum – Command Point bonuses
- Fortress – Defensive bonuses for Battleline units
- Manufactorum – Temporary weapon upgrades
- Hospital – Negates Out-of-Action effects
- Void Port – Grants Deep Strike or enhanced deployment

Only installations **you control** provide benefits.

---

## 10. Recovery Phase

During the Recovery Phase:
- Resolve Out-of-Action tests
- Apply Hospital or Medicae effects
- Update Crusade rosters normally

Hospital installations may negate or modify Out-of-Action results as defined by their rules.

---

## 11. Campaign Victory

The campaign ends when one faction achieves one of the following:
- Controls a majority of Installation Hexes
- Controls the enemy faction’s territory beyond a defined threshold
- A narrative or time-based victory condition is met

Victory should be declared narratively, not mathematically.

---

## 12. Design Notes (Read Once)

- Battles are **earned**, not constant.
- Movement creates tension.
- Spawn Hexes prevent player elimination.
- Installations are the reason to fight.
- Attrition matters.

This system is designed to be expanded, not solved.
