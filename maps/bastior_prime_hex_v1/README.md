# Bastior Prime Hex Map (v1.1)

This is an **expanded** test map intended for D6 (or D3) movement playtests.

Files:
- `map_layout_v1.json` — the full hex grid and installation placement
- `spawns_v1.json` — faction spawn hexes
- `tokens_v1.json` — starting army tokens (optional)

Coordinate system:
- Uses **axial hex coordinates** (q, r).

Map size:
- Radius: 6
- Total hexes: 127

Installations:
- 2× Medicae Facilities (Hospitals)
- 2× Void Ports
- 4× Manufactorum Nodes
- 2× Fortress Complexes
- 3× Hive Ruins
- 1× Administratum Nexus

Notes:
- This map is intentionally large so D6 movement matters and front lines form over multiple rounds.
- No fog-of-war assumed (physical tabletop map is open information).
