# Hex Crusade Installations v1  
### Planetary-Scale Crusade System Addendum

This document defines **Installation Hex** types and their **mechanical effects**.
Unless noted otherwise, installation effects apply **only** if your faction controls the hex and the battle is fought **in that hex**.

---

## Global Installation Rules

### Control Requirement
- An installation provides benefits only at **Controlled** status (not Neutral).

### Two-Installation Selection (Per Battle)
- At the start of each battle, each faction may select **up to TWO** installation effects it currently controls to be **Active** for that battle.
- An installation may only be selected if it is thematically plausible for the battle location (GM veto allowed, used rarely).

> This prevents runaway stacking while still rewarding teams for coordinated territorial play.

### “Once per battle” Timing
- If an effect says “once per battle,” declare its use **before** the relevant roll(s) unless the effect states otherwise.

---

## Installation: Administratum Nexus

**Theme:** Command authority, logistics, strategic approvals.

### Effect
- **Controlled:** Before the battle begins, the controlling player gains **+1 Command Point**.
- **Optional Upgrade (if you later add 75/100 tiers):**
  - 75%: +1 CP
  - 100%: +2 CP

**Notes**
- Command Points gained this way may exceed normal starting limits.

---

## Installation: Fortress Complex

**Theme:** Hardened defensive positions and prepared lines.

### Effect
- **Controlled:** Select **one Battleline unit** in your army.
  - That unit gains **+1 to its Armor Save** while wholly within your deployment zone.

**Notes**
- Units lose the benefit immediately if they leave the deployment zone.
- Does not override game-wide limits on modifying saves.

---

## Installation: Manufactorum Node

**Theme:** War materiel, prototype weapon allocations.

### Effect
- **Controlled:** Once per battle, one unit may add **+1 Strength** to one of its weapon profiles
  for a single Shooting or Fight phase.

**Notes**
- Declare use before making any attack rolls for that phase.

---

## Installation: Hive Ruins (Urban Kill-Zone)

**Theme:** Close-quarters brutality and momentum.

### Effect
- **Controlled:** Units from the controlling army may **Advance and Charge** during this battle.

**Notes**
- Applies to all units unless restricted by their own datasheets.

---

## Installation: Void Port

**Theme:** Rapid insertion, orbital redeployment.

### Effect
- **Controlled:** Before the battle, select **one unit** in your army.
  - That unit gains the **Deep Strike** ability for this battle.

**Notes**
- If the selected unit already has Deep Strike, it may still be selected (no additional benefit in v1 unless you add an upgraded tier later).
- If you later add an upgraded tier, recommended 100% bonus:
  - Precision Insertion: may set up within 3" of enemy units and may Charge that turn (once per battle).

---

## Installation: Medicae Facility (Field Hospital)

**Theme:** Recovery, triage, stabilizing losses.

### Effect (Campaign Layer)
- **Controlled:** Once per campaign round, the controlling faction may **negate the effects of one Out-of-Action roll**
  made for a unit from that faction.

**How to apply**
- After you roll an Out-of-Action result you dislike, you may declare the Medicae use:
  - Treat that unit as **not having suffered** the Out-of-Action result (no Battle Scar / recovery penalty from that roll).

**Notes**
- This does not undo models lost in the battle; it affects post-battle Crusade consequences only.
- If you place **two** Medicae Facilities on the map, each may be used once per round (or you may cap total uses to 1 if testing shows it is too strong).

---

## Optional: “Upgrade Tiers” (If You Want 25/75/100 Later)

If you decide to track installation control tiers later:
- **25%:** installation exists but is disrupted (no benefit)
- **75%:** standard Controlled benefit
- **100%:** enhanced version of the benefit (stronger, but still bounded)

Keep tiering only on installations—not on normal hexes.

---

## Placement Guidance (Quick)

For a large hex map:
- Place **2× Medicae Facilities** roughly central-ish, not on extreme edges.
- Place **1× Administratum**, **1× Fortress**, **2–3× Manufactorum**, **1–2× Void Ports**, **2–4× Hive Ruins**.
- Keep installations spread so teams must choose which fronts matter.
